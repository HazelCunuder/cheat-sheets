## Rules of ergonomics

### 1. **Clear and Intuitive Navigation**

- Keep menus simple and easy to understand.
- Use consistent navigation placement (top or left-side menu).
- Provide a search bar for quick access to content.

### 2. **Readable and Accessible Typography**

- Use web-safe fonts with a minimum size of **16px** for body text.
- Ensure proper contrast between text and background for readability.
- Maintain an optimal line length (50-75 characters per line).
- Use headings and subheadings to break up large text blocks.

### 3. **Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Design**

- Ensure your website adapts to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use flexible grids and scalable images.
- Test across multiple devices and browsers.

### 4. **Fast Loading Speed**

- Optimize images and use modern formats like WebP.
- Minimize the use of heavy scripts and third-party plugins.
- Enable browser caching and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### 5. **Consistent and Simple Layout**

- Use a clean, organized grid structure.
- Maintain consistency in color scheme, typography, and spacing.
- Group related elements together for better readability.
- Avoid clutter—prioritize whitespace for a balanced look.

### 6. **Accessibility for All Users**

- Follow **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
- Provide **alt text** for images and meaningful link text.
- Ensure keyboard navigability for users who don’t use a mouse.
- Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles when necessary.

### 7. **Visual Comfort and Contrast**

- Avoid excessive animations or flashing elements that can be distracting.
- Maintain a **high contrast ratio** (4.5:1 or higher for body text).
- Use a **limited color palette** to create a cohesive design.
- Provide a **dark mode option** for user preference.

### 8. **Interactive and Feedback Mechanisms**

- Ensure buttons, links, and forms provide immediate visual feedback.
- Use hover states, pressed states, and loading indicators.
- Provide success messages after form submissions or user actions.

## User Experience Guidelines

### 1. **User-Centered Design**

- Understand your audience through research and user personas.  
- Design with accessibility in mind to accommodate all users.  
- Prioritize user needs over aesthetics—functionality comes first.  

### 2. **Simplicity and Clarity**

- Keep interfaces clean and free from unnecessary elements.  
- Use familiar UI patterns that users already understand.  
- Make content easy to scan with clear headings and bullet points.  

### 3. **Effortless Navigation**

- Ensure navigation is intuitive with a clear menu structure.  
- Use a logical information hierarchy and breadcrumb trails.  
- Provide a search function for quick content discovery.  

### 4. **Consistency Across the Website**

- Maintain a uniform color scheme, typography, and layout.  
- Use consistent UI elements (buttons, icons, forms).  
- Follow brand identity to create a seamless experience.  

### 5. **Fast and Responsive Performance**

- Optimize images and code to ensure fast load times.  
- Minimize heavy scripts and third-party plugins.

### 6. **Engaging Visual Design**

- Use a balanced color palette to enhance aesthetics.  
- Apply whitespace effectively to avoid clutter.  
- Use high-quality visuals that support content and branding.  

### 7. **User Feedback and Interaction**

- Provide real-time feedback (e.g., button hover effects, form validation).  
- Use microinteractions to enhance engagement subtly.  
- Offer clear error messages with solutions when users encounter issues.  

### 8. **Mobile-First Approach**

- Design for mobile devices first, then scale up to larger screens.  
- Ensure touch-friendly buttons and easy-to-read text.  
- Test usability on different devices and screen sizes.  

### 9. **Continuous Testing and Improvement**

- Conduct A/B testing to optimize design elements.  
- Collect user feedback through surveys and analytics.  
- Iterate based on real user behavior and pain points.
