## Rules of ergonomics

### 1. **Clear and Intuitive Navigation**

- Keep menus simple and easy to understand.
- Use consistent navigation placement (top or left-side menu).
- Provide a search bar for quick access to content.

### 2. **Readable and Accessible Typography**

- Use web-safe fonts with a minimum size of **16px** for body text.
- Ensure proper contrast between text and background for readability.
- Maintain an optimal line length (50-75 characters per line).
- Use headings and subheadings to break up large text blocks.

### 3. **Responsive and Mobile-Friendly Design**

- Ensure your website adapts to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use flexible grids and scalable images.
- Test across multiple devices and browsers.

### 4. **Fast Loading Speed**

- Optimize images and use modern formats like WebP.
- Minimize the use of heavy scripts and third-party plugins.
- Enable browser caching and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### 5. **Consistent and Simple Layout**

- Use a clean, organized grid structure.
- Maintain consistency in color scheme, typography, and spacing.
- Group related elements together for better readability.
- Avoid clutter—prioritize whitespace for a balanced look.

- Use a **limited color palette** to create a cohesive design.
- Provide a **dark mode option** for user preference.

### 8. **Interactive and Feedback Mechanisms**

- Ensure buttons, links, and forms provide immediate visual feedback.
