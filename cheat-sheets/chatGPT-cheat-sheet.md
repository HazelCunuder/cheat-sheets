## About ChatGPT

Unless you've been living inside of a cave for the last 10 years, you know what ChatGPT is, but for the few concerned, here's a little description.

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developped by OpenAI, it is a large language model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based neural networks. ChatGPT works by analyzing vast amounts of text data and predicting the most relevant responses based on context. It processes user input, identifies patterns, and generates coherent and context-aware replies in real time. Its capabilities include answering questions, assisting with writing, coding, brainstorming, and more.

## Basics

### The Prompt box

The first thing to understand is the prompt box, this is where you'll be inputting everything you want ChatGPT to know and do. You can pretty much ask it everything, from writing essays, to simple pasta recipes. However, the results might not be all accurate.

### Example

Ask ChatGPT a simple Spaghetti Bolognese recipe: "How can I make Spaghetti Bolognese?"

It might answer something akin to this:

## Role Prompting

<div id="about-rp"/>

### What is Role Prompting?

Role prompting is a method that consist of telling ChatGPT to endorse the role of someone specific, in order to fine tune the answers it gives back.

This provides some context to the AI, helping it give you more accurate answers on a specific topic.

<div id=="example-rp"/>

### Example

To continue our Spaghetti example, if we tell ChatGPT that they are a 3 Star Michelin Chef before asking them for a Spaghetti Bolognese, the answer is going to be completely different, as well as the tone of ChatGPT.

As you can see, compared to the first result, when we didn't ask GPT to endorse a role, this answer is much more detailed and specific.

## Using it to Code

Now, you might be thinking:

>"But Hazel, how is knowing how to ask ChatGPT to give me a Spaghetti Bolognese recipe going to help me code?"

Well, this is what this part is for.

<div id="rp-code"/>

### Role playing

As stated before, asking ChatGPT to endorse a role prior to asking him a question helps it give you a more detailed answer. We can use this to our advantage whenever we need to enquire its help for coding related questions.

Depending on the project, you can ask ChatGPT to take on the mantle of a Senior Full Stack Developer, a Javascript savant, or even Guido Van Rossum, creator of Python.

Once in character, ChatGPT will be able to help you more effectively.

### Asking it the right questions

You've asked ChatGPT to play the role of an expert developer, so... now what?

Well, now is the time to ask your question.

But don't just go 

> "How make game not broken?"

No, you need to be precise in what you're asking if you need it's help fixing an error, detail your process and give the error message you got. Doing so before asking the AI to help you will help it understand how you got that error, and which step went wrong.

This will help the AI identify the root of the problem and give you a hand for fixing it.

<div id='reliability'/>

## Reliability

But how do I know that ChatGPT's answer will actually work? Well, unfortunately, no AI can guarantee a 100% success rate. However, there are ways to make the answers more reliable.

The method I found the most consistent is to ask ChatGPT to give you a step-by-step explanation of its answer. This gives you a way to understand and verify the AI's thought process and prune out false information.
