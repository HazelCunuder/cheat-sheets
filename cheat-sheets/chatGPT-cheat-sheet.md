## About ChatGPT

Unless you've been living inside of a cave for the last 10 years, you know what ChatGPT is, but for the few concerned, here's a little description.

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developped by OpenAI, it is a large language model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based neural networks. ChatGPT works by analyzing vast amounts of text data and predicting the most relevant responses based on context. It processes user input, identifies patterns, and generates coherent and context-aware replies in real time. Its capabilities include answering questions, assisting with writing, coding, brainstorming, and more.

### The Prompt box

The first thing to understand is the prompt box, this is where you'll be inputting everything you want ChatGPT to know and do. You can pretty much ask it everything, from writing essays, to simple pasta recipes. However, the results might not be all accurate.

## Role Prompting

<div id="about-rp"/>

### What is Role Prompting?

Role prompting is a method that consist of telling ChatGPT to endorse the role of someone specific, in order to fine tune the answers it gives back.

This provides some context to the AI, helping it give you more accurate answers on a specific topic.

### Example

To continue our Spaghetti example, if we tell ChatGPT that they are a 3 Star Michelin Chef before asking them for a Spaghetti Bolognese, the answer is going to be completely different, as well as the tone of ChatGPT.
